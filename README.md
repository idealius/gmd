### GMD - 
Linux Desktop Conky process resource monitoring desktop panel with cpu (%) and mem totals (in MB.) It can use Node.js. Defaults to an awk shell version for speed. Currently, to install this one needs to be familiar with Conky and Linux shell at a minimum.

This project allowed me to gain experience with nodejs on the Linux command line, writing code to improve execution speed, considerations about different sorting methods, and gain familiarity with some of the Linux base code.

I also wrote it because I have 2008 iMac I wanted to repurpose running LinuxMint, resource monitoring is very useful for making sure it is running smoothly, and there seemed to be a gap in low resource, in my opinion useful (grouping same name processes), easily customized (relatively) in the Linux Desktop ecosystem.
